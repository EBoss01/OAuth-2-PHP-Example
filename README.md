OAuth-2-PHP-Example
===================

This is a simple example of how to implement OAuth 2.  You can simply install the files in a folder on your server, navigate to the folder, and follow the steps to authenticate using OAuth 2.  At the end, you will want to store the access token that in generated inside the config.php file that you use for your application, or store it in a database. You will "Authorize", login, "Grant Access", and "Click here", and finally get to a page that shows your access token, which never expires.
